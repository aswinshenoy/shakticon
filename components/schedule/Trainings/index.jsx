                    This training is the shortened version of my original "Reversing and Auditing C++ Binaries", this
                    course will be a class for security researchers who want to expand their horizons and skills in
                    reversing C++ binaries.
                </p>
                <p>
                    C++ Binaries are full of mysteries, they have objects, inheritance, templates, vtables and many
                    more and reverse engineering them is a task on its own. In order to correctly and clearly map a
                    C++ compiled binary it requires a vast knowledge of C++ Internals.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The training will explain C++ reverse engineering topics including techniques and tools for
                    dealing with C++ Binaries research. We will start with the identification of basic structures
                    in C++ and continue with C++ Objects and Inheritance in a binary and how to represent them in IDA.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Afterward, we will also study work methods and design patterns in C++. Finally, we will practice,
                    fight and untangle deep and modern C++ programs using static and dynamic analysis.

                Modern Windows systems, and a little bit extra. We will learn how to attach a kernel debugger to a machine, locally and remotely, and how that can help us in both our development process and in our security research. We'll learn how to examine internal mechanisms in Windows through a debugger and new tricks and techniques that make debugging a lot easier. This workshop will focus on kernel debugging but will touch user-mode debugging as well, showing how to find and recognize indicators of suspicious activity in the system

                This training will introduce you to web application penetration testing on a single page
                application and get you familiar with some of the OWASP Top 10. We'll start by learning
                some basics about single page applications and how they're setup, and some of the tools,
                resources and options for enumerating and attacking web applications.  We'll then move on

                into practice attacking the OWASP Juice Shop.  We can explore other topics as time permits.

                    Moving from old black and white phones to Smartphones were super exciting. We were amused by the features and services whereas least interested in how it works. We did install a lot of apps in ease of touch without a second thought. Now letâ€™s look from a security perspective. The permissions we granted, unofficial app stores we used, recalling data privacy was that a good decision? This training would give you a clarity on how apps work below the surface and things to be concerned off.

                    This training would introduce you to reversing and analyzing Android apps. As this is an introductory training we would cover fundamentals and basics of Android Security. Some reliable tools and techniques for reversing and analyzing would be discussed. We would then head to dissection of an Android app and inspect for malicious behavior by Static and Dynamic analysis. By the end of the session, one would learn to,

1. Reverse an Android App
2. Perform Static & Dynamic Analysis
3. Detect suspicious and malicious apps

                This training will introduce you to the basic of traffic analysis. We will see how messages and
                files are transmitted over the network depending on the protocol being used and see which of
                them send the data encrypted and which not. The training will explain what are the things you
                need to focus on when analyzing a traffic dump and what kind of data and information you can get
                from it. You want to know how to get confidential information sent over the network? Or how an
                attack looks like from the packets perspective? We will finish the training by analyzing a couple
                of example so you can get your hand dirty!

                intimidated by assembly? Then this workshop is for you! In this 2 hour workshop, you're going to learn
                about and how to do binary reverse engineering. In this workshop, no knowledge of assembly is needed.
                Only a basic comfort in understanding pseudo code is required. We'll cover the different types of
                reverse engineering, how you do it, and (hopefully!) why it's so much fun. You'll finish the
                workshop having reversed your own little program!

                <p>
                    Symbolic execution is a powerful tool for code verification, bug hunting and reverse engineering.
                    In this class, we will dive into the concepts of constraint programming and SMT solvers and how
                    binary analysis tools, such as angr, integrate these concepts into their frameworks.

                <p>
                    It is going to be a very practical class, where we are going to solve various CTF challenges with
                    the goal of visiting different features of angr.

                <p>
                    Most of CTF players use z3 and angr to save time when solving reverse engineering challenge and
                    that is also the path we are going to take.

                        ThaÃ­s Moreira Hamasaki is an Offensive Security Researcher @ Intel - STORM. Previous to that, she
                        worked as a Malware Researcher @ F-Secure, with a focus on static analysis, reverse engineering,
                        and logical programming.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        ThaÃ­s started her career within the anti-virus industry working on data and malware analysis,
                        where she developed her knowledge of threat protection systems. She won the "best rookie speaker"
                        award from BSides London for her very first talk about "Using SMT solvers to deobfuscate malware binaries".
                        Recent research topics include platform security, SMM, and GFX. She is a member of the
                        DÃ¼sseldorf Hackerspace aka Chaosdorf, where she also leads the groups for Reverse Engineering and
                        x86 Assembly. In her free time, you can find ThaÃ­s writing bad code, cooking, or climbing
                        somewhere offline.

                <p>Have you ever wanted to know why Firefox warns you about concretely when the big "THIS PAGE IS UNSECURE" appears ?</p>
                <p>Well, in this workshop we will be doing what Firefox tries to protect you from: Eavesdropping someone's network.</p>
                <div>We'll go from theory to practice:</div>
                <div>How do you get packets supposed to go from a computer to another to come to your machine ?</div>
                <div>
                    That's called the Women-In-The-Middle attack, and we'll use Scapy (pre-installed in kali linux) to
                    do that using a technique called ARP-Spoofiing.
                </div>
                <div>
                    And even if this look fun, you might know that nowadays traffic is encrypted so what can we do with these encrypted packets ?
                </div>
                <div>
                    Firstly we'll go through the basics of TLS, seeing how does your connection gets encrypted and how the trust
                    between client and server is built : that's the part where certificates signature and verification arrives.
                </div>
                <div>
                    With these basics, we'll see what could go wrong, what happens if you say to firefox "No, I understand the risks and continue" from the attacker's perspective.
                </div>
                <div>
                    I have prepared pair of VMs for each of you and you will be able to really eavesdrop on this small environment - it's really a hands on intro to WITM attacks and network interception.
                </div>
                <div>
                    After this training, you will:
                </div>
                <ul>
                    <li>have performed a WITM attack with Scapy</li>
                    <li>know how to manually generate TLS certificates</li>
                    <li>have a better idea of what Burp or ZAP proxy do when they "intercept TLS traffic"</li>
                    <li>better understand your browser's security messages</li>
                    <li>have an overview of what TLS is for and what is concretly protects us from</li>
                </ul>
