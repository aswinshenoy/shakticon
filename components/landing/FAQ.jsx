                <p>
                    This conference is only for women (including non-binary people identifying as women).
                    If you are eligible for prizes in the contest, you will be contacted for identity
                    verification so that the game stays fair for all participants.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We welcome all women (including non-binary people identifying as women) who have the
                    curiosity to try new things and interest in cybersecurity to take part in this conference.
                    No previous cybersecurity experience is needed.
                </p>

            "answer": <>
                As this conference aims at bridging the diversity gap in the field of cybersecurity, there will be a
                verification process on an individual basis to validate participantâ€™s identity before being allowed
                to participate in training or any events. You will get more details regarding this once you sign
                up for our events.

        },
        {
            "question": "How do I start learning?",
            "answer": <>
                You can start learning by going through the basics of each category given on bi0s wiki.
